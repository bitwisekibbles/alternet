# Alternet
Alternet is a TCP/IP based information transfer protocol with an emphasis on simplicity. The alternet protocol attempts to circumvent the many unneeded complexities of HTTP. Some of the improvements include the following:
  - No attached environment (CSS, Javascript, PHP, etc...) and more emphasis on the transfer of data
  - Allows users to configure clients to render data as they please while still allowing the server to announce the rendering preference
  - Pages are written in a markdown variant making life easier for the renderer and the writer
  - Lightweight server-side scripts written in C using libAlternet
